<p> My name is Zack Pincince and I am a Freshman at the University of New Haven. I am studying Sport Managemnet with a minor in Communications. I came to this school because of the excellent program they have and so I can play baseball. In school I am also an active member of the Charger Bulletin, which is our school newspaper.</p>
